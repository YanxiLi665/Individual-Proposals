    "\n",
    "**5. Interpret Results:**\n",
    "- If the p-value is below a chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that loneliness in this sample is significantly different from the population mean.\n",

    "**Expected Outcome:**\n",
    "- If the sample's loneliness levels differ significantly from the hypothesized mean, this could suggest unique loneliness patterns within this group, potentially warranting further study into causes and interventions."
